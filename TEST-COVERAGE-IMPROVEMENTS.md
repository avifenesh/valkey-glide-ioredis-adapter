# Test Coverage Improvements Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive test suite expansion to achieve 80%+ coverage goal using ioredis-compatible test patterns.

## Test Files Created

### 1. **Fastify Redis Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/fastify-redis.test.mjs`)
- Tests compatibility with @fastify/redis plugin
- Covers common patterns: sessions, caching, rate limiting, pub/sub
- Validates distributed locking (Redlock pattern)
- Tests pipeline operations and stream processing
- **Coverage Impact**: Integration patterns widely used in production

### 2. **GEO Commands Tests** (`tests/unit/geo-commands.test.mjs`)
- Previously: 8.58% coverage
- Comprehensive tests for all GEO operations
- GEOADD, GEOPOS, GEODIST, GEORADIUS, GEOSEARCH
- Edge cases and error handling
- Real-world location tracking patterns
- **Status**: Most tests passing, some option handling needs fixes

### 3. **HyperLogLog Commands Tests** (`tests/unit/hll-commands.test.mjs`)
- Previously: 18.75% coverage
- Complete PFADD, PFCOUNT, PFMERGE coverage
- Cardinality estimation use cases
- Visitor tracking, unique counts, merge operations
- Performance characteristics validation
- **Status**: Core functionality tests passing

### 4. **Scripting Commands Tests** (`tests/unit/scripting-commands.test.mjs`)
- Previously: 17.1% coverage
- Full Lua scripting support tests
- EVAL, EVALSHA, SCRIPT commands
- Real-world patterns: CAS, rate limiting, distributed locks
- Error handling and edge cases
- **Status**: Script execution tests functional

### 5. **Enhanced Stream Commands Tests** (`tests/unit/enhanced-stream-commands.test.mjs`)
- Previously: 9.02% coverage
- Comprehensive stream operations coverage
- Consumer groups, XREAD, XADD, XCLAIM
- Event sourcing and message queue patterns
- Log aggregation use cases
- **Status**: Core stream operations working

### 6. **ioredis Compatibility Test Suite** (`tests/ioredis-compat/`)
Created based on ioredis GitHub test patterns:
- `connection.test.mjs` - Connection management patterns
- `pipeline.test.mjs` - Pipeline and batch operations
- `commands.test.mjs` - All Redis command categories
- `pubsub-transaction.test.mjs` - Pub/Sub and transactions
- `comprehensive-coverage.test.mjs` - Additional coverage areas

## Coverage Areas Addressed

### High Impact Modules (Previously Low Coverage)
1. **geo.ts** (8.58% → Targeted for 80%+)
   - All GEO commands now tested
   - Real-world geospatial patterns

2. **streams.ts** (9.02% → Targeted for 80%+)
   - Complete stream lifecycle tests
   - Consumer group management
   - Production message queue patterns

3. **hll.ts** (18.75% → Targeted for 80%+)
   - All HyperLogLog operations covered
   - Cardinality estimation scenarios

4. **scripting.ts** (17.1% → Targeted for 80%+)
   - Lua script execution tests
   - Script caching and management

## Real-World Patterns Validated

### From Popular Libraries
- **Fastify/Redis**: Plugin integration, session storage
- **Bull/BullMQ**: Queue patterns (already working)
- **Express-session**: Session management patterns
- **Socket.IO**: Pub/Sub adapter patterns
- **Rate limiting**: Sliding window, token bucket

### Production Use Cases
1. **Caching Strategies**
   - Cache-aside pattern
   - Cache tags for invalidation
   - TTL management

2. **Distributed Systems**
   - Distributed locking (Redlock)
   - Event sourcing with streams
   - Message queues with consumer groups

3. **Real-time Features**
   - Pub/Sub for live updates
   - Pattern subscriptions
   - Stream-based event processing

4. **Data Analytics**
   - Unique visitor tracking (HLL)
   - Geospatial queries
   - Time-series with streams

## Test Execution Status

### Working Tests
- Basic Redis operations ✅
- String, Hash, List, Set, ZSet commands ✅
- Transactions and pipelines ✅
- Most GEO operations ✅
- HLL core functionality ✅
- Stream basic operations ✅
- Lua script execution ✅

### Areas Needing Refinement
- Some GEO option flags (NX, XX, CH)
- Complex stream consumer group operations
- Some script management commands
- Cluster-specific patterns

## Next Steps to Achieve 80%+ Coverage

1. **Fix remaining test failures**
   - Resolve option handling in GEO commands
   - Fix consumer group edge cases
   - Address script management issues

2. **Add missing command coverage**
   - Bitmap operations
   - Advanced server commands
   - Cluster-specific operations

3. **Optimize test execution**
   - Reduce timeouts for faster runs
   - Parallel test execution where possible
   - Better test isolation

## Estimated Coverage Impact

Based on the test files created:
- **Current baseline**: ~36% overall
- **Expected with new tests**: 65-75% 
- **Target**: 80%+
- **Gap to close**: Additional focused tests on remaining uncovered areas

## Key Achievement
Successfully created ioredis-compatible test suite that validates real-world usage patterns from popular Node.js libraries, ensuring the adapter works correctly with existing ioredis-dependent applications.
